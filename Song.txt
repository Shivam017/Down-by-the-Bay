# Down-by-the-Bay

Down by the bay
Where the watermelons grow
Back to my home
I dare not go
For if I do
My mother will say

"Did you ever see a goose
Kissing a moose?"
Down by the bay.

As a snake that loves to crawl
and a bird that hates to fall
I would never go back home as-
In the light I saw a waterfall
